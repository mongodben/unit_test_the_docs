# Write Data

Write data to a realm within a `Realm.write()` transaction block:

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">{WriteData}</CodeBlock>

## Create a New Object

To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other object
and then pass it to `Realm.create()` inside of a write transaction.
If the realm's schema includes the object type and the object conforms to the schema,
then Realm stores the object, which is now managed by the realm.
